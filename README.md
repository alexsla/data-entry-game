# data-entry-game

A simply web game to train users in data entry protocols and pitfalls.
Users can click on one of several sites in a map. Once clicked, six pokemon are randomly encountered based on the local weather conditions in the site. The attributes of the pokemon are listed.

That's pretty much it.
